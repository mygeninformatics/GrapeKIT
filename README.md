## Welcome to GrapeKIT - Grape genome toolkit from KIT

Genomic resource are extremely important in the current-day data-driven scientific approaches. To utilize the full potential of available grape (Vitis sp.) germplasm in our botanical garden, we have sequenced nearly 90 Vitis accessions from various geographical locations. These resources provide us an opportunity to investigate the genetic factors behind the various important traits of interest. 

To get access to the data, please contact [Prof. Peter Nick](https://www.botanik.kit.edu/botzell/english/1134.php).
